Q&A


Is the Release Tracking Sheet the same as the Variable Tracking Sheet?
Variable Tracking Sheet: Lists data availability and anomalies variable by variable - to be filled in by micro processor as part of processing
Release Tracking Sheet: A separate document edited by the entire team providing a general overview of where things are in the process by election study. Project management tool assigning responsibilities and schedules.

What are common issues in data deposits? Where should quality checks focus?
Regarding study design and eligibility, see guideline at 'CSES Dropbox/CSES Secretariat II/CSES Guidelines & Policies/CSES - Study Eligibility Checklist' for assistance.
Other common issues:
• Missing documents (design report, macro report, questionnaires). We usually don't start processing before we receive the design report, unless we are certain of the study's eligibility for CSES. Macro processing can usually start before the macro report is deposited, if necessary, but the macro report is required to finish macro processing as well.
• Partial deposits, such as incomplete Design Reports. We can handle that by sending collaborator questions if this concerns details not required to assess a study's eligibility (e.g., in case of missing response rates).
• Unlabeled datasets (fine, as long as we receive an accompanying codebook or questionnaire listing codes, etc.). Otherwise, we might reach out to the collaborator ahead of processing.
• Missing or duplicate respondent IDs (we can create them if required, but we prefer collaborators providing them).
What is the full folder structure beyond [COUNTRY]_[YEAR]/micro/?
• Election results: includes template for election results table
• Emails: includes all communication with collaborators – questions asked ahead of depositing, data/document deposits, collaborator questions sent, answers received, communication at vetting, etc.
• Macro: includes processing files for macro
• Micro: includes processing files for micro
• References: includes papers etc. used for processing the study, if not listed elsewhere
• To-Do: includes an empty to do list (personally, I rarely use this folder)
What is the typical deposit structure from national collaborators? I.e where are files deposited?
Available in the "Emails" folder on Dropbox in the respective election study's subfolder at 'CSES Dropbox/CSES Secretariat II/CSES Data Products/CSES Standalone Modules/Module 6/Election Studies'
Where are the current syntax templates located, and how can you verify that they are up to date?
All required templates are available at 'CSES Dropbox/CSES Secretariat II/CSES Data Products/CSES Standalone Modules/Module 6/Election Studies/z) COUNTRY_YEAR_M6'
Also see Micro Processing I Training – Slide 40 for a screenshot
Up-to-datedness: 
Usually, templates are created once ahead of a Module, and updated as required based on past experiences (i.e., after a release cycle). Typically, the person updating the template files sends an email (or a Slack notification) to all coders, alerting them that a new version of the file is available.
Where are variable tracking sheets located, and how to identify if it's up to date?
Templates for variable tracking sheets are provided within the 'z) COUNTRY_YEAR_M6' folder. They are usually set up once per Module only, as they are based on the Module questionnaire, which usually does not change retroactively.
How are Party Codes updated, as the training files label files should not be modified?
Excellent question, as we might not have this documented as part of the training yet. Label files to be modified during processing are provided within the 'z) COUNTRY_YEAR_M6' folder.
For details on handling labels during micro data processing, see Micro Processing I Training, slides 63-66.
Once you're done with processing a study, you may copy-paste your labels into a "label dump file" available on Dropbox (I created them for M6 AR3 last Friday, on January 9, 2026):
'CSES Dropbox/CSES Secretariat II/CSES Data Products/CSES Standalone Modules/Module 6/CSES6 AR3/Labels/Label Additions for CSES6 AR3'
For micro, the file looks as follows:
Ahead of each cross-national phase, one person is typically assigned responsibility to integrate all label additions from the label dump file into the master label files used for creating the cross-national dataset.
For M6 AR3, the master label files are available at:
'CSES Dropbox/CSES Secretariat II/CSES Data Products/CSES Standalone Modules/Module 6/CSES6 AR3/Labels'
